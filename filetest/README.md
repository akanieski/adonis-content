# File upload sample

So here I'm using web sockets to upload a file.. and then alerting other users that the file has been made available. Then allows user to click the link and download the newly available file.

Source code can mostly be found in `resources/welcome.edge` and `app/Controllers/Ws/FileUploadController.js`.

It should look like this!
